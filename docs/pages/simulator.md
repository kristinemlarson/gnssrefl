# The Simulator

The GNSS-IR simulator was written by Felipe Nievinski.
The Matlab/octave code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/fgnievinski/mpsim).
Just use the usual git clone command to download it.
It is documented in two papers - 
[the longer one](https://www.kristinelarson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nievinski_Larson_2013.pdf) 
delves more into the models while
[the second one](https://www.kristinelarson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Nievinski_Simulator.pdf) 
is an introduction to the code.

In particular, in your local files, see <a href=https://github.com/fgnievinski/mpsim/tree/master/lib/snr/demo/>the lib/snr/demo subdirectory</a>.
You can open it in your local browser.
He also provides matlab code these examples, i.e.
[for a layered case](https://github.com/fgnievinski/mpsim/blob/master/lib/snr/demo/snr_demo_layer.m).
