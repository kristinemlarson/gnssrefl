[build-system]

# setup.py script requires numpy to be installed in order to configure
# the Fortran bindings. setuptools and wheel are standard
# dependencies, as per [1]. See [2] for discussion of why the numpy
# build-time dependency causes a problem and how this configuration in
# pyproject.toml solves the problem, which has been well-known in the
# Python packaging community for quite some time.
