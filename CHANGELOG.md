# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## 1.2.20

Accommodated CDDIS file structure change for MGEX orbits.

## 1.2.19
Changed how the periodograms in quickLook are displayed. Initially tried to 
set to the maximum used by matplotlib.  This can be dominated by bad tracks, so 
now pick by maximum good track (times 1.1).  If there are not any good tracks at all 
this can be tricky.  Now using a min value of 2 for that. 

Restricting RH region to be at least 5.5 meters (consistent with gnssir). This is needed
to stop people using RH region to remove outliers.  The RH region also determines whether
the periodogram is valid.

Fixing the refl_zones restriction of 25 degrees elevation angle.  Increasing to 30 degrees
and providing error message.

refl_zones now writes out satellite number and elevation angle in the kml file.
Makes it easier for people to take out specific Fresnel zones if they wish.

## 1.2.18

Changed default RH max in quickLook to 8 meters.

Multiple azimuth regions allowed in refl_zones. Documentation updated.

## 1.2.17

Require RH constraints (set in make_json_input or by hand) and then invoked 
by gnssir **must** be at least 5 meters apart. These are used for the periodogram 
and for quality control. Sometimes people think this setting is only for outliers.  Outliers can still be 
removed in **subdaily** with RH constraints.  For now I am going to continue allowing this kind of 
constraint in **quickLook**, but eventually I may remove it there too.  

Changed make_json_input default max RH to 8 meters.  Slight change to peak2noise default.
The first change will make peak2noise stats higher in general.

## 1.2.16

Added reflector height plot in subdaily that shows the results with respect to 
azimuth. Should hopefully make it easier to track down azimuth issues for a mask.

Upon request, subdaily writes out evenly sampled RH values for the last spline fit.

## 1.2.15

Add newest L2C transmitting GPS satellite, PRN 28. Transmitting since January 31, 2023.
I do not believe it is healthy.

y-axis limits are now the same in quickLook periodograms.

Add L1C (I think) to rinex3 reading code - but it is a backup signal to default L1 C/A (S1C).  
But I would really need to see more receivers to see what is going on here.  They all seem to 
use different settings. 

Fixed persistent bugs that occur when trying to use gnssir to isolate problems with one satellite.
Now checks that the requested satellite is available on the requested frequency.
If not, it exits gracefully instead of crashing. This is when using -sat option, which is not
relevant for routine processing.

## 1.2.14

Allow capital letter station names in quickLook and gnssir (mac does not distinguish
between these two cases, but other machines do).

Explicitly check that people are not using illegal frequencies when they run gnssir

Fix bugs in nmea2snr related to how directories were created and discontinued numpy libraries

Updated snowdepth to have user-friendler bare soil definitions.

## 1.2.13

Added initial snowdepth utility.

removed np.float and np.int from gps.py library (no longer defined in newer numpy versions)

## 1.2.12
Slight changes to the behavior of refl_zones - it make a station icon and the output goes
to a subdirectory now to decrease the clutter in $REFL_CODE/Files.

Added more optional inputs to quickplt

## 1.2.11

Added Glonass to <code>nmea2snr</code>. Thank you to Daniel Nowacki for helping on this one.

## 1.2.10
Added a new utility - <code>rh_plot</code> - which is basically a way to look at RH results before you start making 
products (snow, sea level, etc). It uses libraries developed for subdaily and daily_avg


## 1.2.9

Fixed bug for multi-freq json analysis instructions when there are no Beidou data.
Even if there were no Beidou data in the RINEX file, gnssir will fail.

## 1.2.8

New pypi with a successful automated build

## 1.2.7

New pypi build, working on automating build.

## 1.2.6

Uploaded this version to pypi on December 26, 2022

Bugs:

Fixed bug in -dec option in gnssir. Previously failed if the data were not multi-GNSS.

## 1.2.5

New Feature:

New command line tool - quickplt. It will plot plain text files, 
presumably time series on x-axis - will convert to datetime, reverse sign 
of the y-values etc.

## 1.2.4

Improvements:

* Subdaily writes out evenly sampled results if requested. This is from 
a spline fit - to the reflector height observations and thus is dependent 
on the assumption that the water level is smooth.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed a bug for delTmax in quickLook that had been changed to 45 minutes - 
returned it to 75 minutes to accommondate snow/soil moisture applications.
I had fixed it in make_json_input, but not in quickLook.

## 1.2.3 

Improvements:

* Added azlist to make_json_input command line.  This means you can control 
the azimuth regions without editing the json file. Thre regions are entered in
pairs, i.e. 0 90 180 270 would be the northeast and southwest regions.

* Added frlist to make_json_input command line. This allows simpler access to 
the multi-constellation frequencies, i.e. 1,2,101,102 would be the original 
GPS and Glonass frequencies.

## 1.2.2

* I had tried out making delTmax input for gnssir to 45 minutes, but that is way too short for soil moisture.
I put it back to 75 minutes. For sea level studies where you expect tidal ranges to be significant over
an arc, you should be careful with this parameter.

## 1.2.1

Bugfixes:

* Fixed output in subdaily. The file with the IF correction was wrong.


## 1.1.12 

Improvements:

* The Files directory was getting too cluttered. I now create and use 
a subdirectory for results. The subdirectory is the same as the 4 character
station name unless subdir is chosen on the command line. This has been 
linked for vwc, daily_avg, subdaily and the plots for quickLook

* added IF bias correction to subdaily 

Bugs:

* csv outputs are currently not working in subdaily.

## 1.1.11

??

## 1.1.10 

Improvements:

* Rewrote the spline fit used in subdaily. It no longer cuts off data at the
beginning and end of the data series.  

* Output files are written with the are interfrequency bias corrected relative to L1.
This output is written to a new column.

* Improved the document header for the RHdot correction

## 1.1.9 

Improvements:

* Added ediff as commandline input to quickLook. The default is 2 degrees and is meant as a 
quality control parameters. If you choose 5 and 20 degrees as your elevation angle limits, this 
would mean your arcs should be at least from 7 to 18 degrees.  If you want to 
allow shorter arcs than this, you can make ediff much larger. Within gnssir, it can be defined 
in the json file.


## 1.1.8 

New Features:

* refl_zones module added. Command line driven.

* EGM96 is now accessible from gps.py. This provides simple geoid corrections in meters 
as a function of latitude and longitude.

Improvements:

* updated download_ioc to allow multi month downloads.


## 1.1.7 

Bug fixes:

* fixed bug in invsnr that did not allow SNR files unless they were uncompressed.
Code now allows xz and gz compression

## 1.1.6 

New Features:

* Changed how CDDIS archive is used, from a wget subprocess call to using FTPS.
This required checking that downloaded file was not zero size.


## 1.1.5 

New Features:

* [Soil moisture module added](https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl/blob/master/docs/pages/README_vwc.md)
vwc_input and vwc are the main programs.
