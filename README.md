### News <a name="news"></a>

We now have three translation options for RINEX files: fortran, hybrid, and python. The last of these
is ok for 30 sec data but really too slow otherwise. Hybrid binds the python to fortran.
So far this is for GPS only RINEX files.  If you need fast multi-GNSS solutions, I still
recommend you install the fortran code (gnssSNR).

[We have started putting together a set of use cases.](https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl/blob/master/tests/first_drivethru.md)

CDDIS is an important GNSS data archive. Because of the way that CDDIS has 
implemented security restrictions, we have had to change our download access. 
For this reason we strongly urge that you install **wget** on your machine and that 
it live in your path. You will only have very limited analysis abilities without it.

I have added more defaults so you don't have to make so many decisions. The defaults are that  
you are using GPS receiver (not GNSS) and have a fairly standard geodetic 
site (i.e. not super tall, < 5 meters). If you have previously used this package, please
note these changes to **rinex2snr**, **quickLook**, and **gnssir**.
Optional commandline inputs are still allowed.

How can you learn how to run this code correctly? You should start by reading
[Roesler and Larson, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-018-0744-8). 
Although this article was originally written to accompany Matlab scripts,
the principles are the same. It explains to you what a reflection
zone means and what a Nyquist frequency is for GNSS reflections. 
My reflection zone webapp will [help you pick appropriate elevation and azimuth angles.](https://gnss-reflections.org/rzones) 

If you are interested in measuring sea level, this webapp tells you [how high your site is above 
sea level.](https://gnss-reflections.org/geoid)  

### Philosophical Statement <a name="philosophy"></a>
In geodesy, you don't really need to know much about what you are doing to 
calculate a reasonably precise position from GPS data. That's just the way it is.
(Note: that is also thanks to the hard work of the geodesists that wrote the 
computer codes). For GPS/GNSS reflections, you need to know a little bit more - like what are you
trying to do? Are you trying to measure water levels? Then you need to know where the water
is! (with respect to your antenna, i.e. which azimuths are good and which are bad). 
Another application of this code is to measure snow accumulation. If you 
have a bunch of obstructions near your antenna, 
you are responsible for knowing not to use that region. If your antenna is 10 meters 
above the reflection area, and the software default only computes answers up to 6 meters,
the code will not tell you anything useful. It is up to you to know what is best for the site and 
modify the inputs accordingly. 
I encourage you to get to know your site. If it belongs to you, look at 
photographs. If you can't find photographs, use Google Earth. 


### Code Description<a name="code"></a>

**gnssrefl** is a new version of my GNSS interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) code. 

The main difference bewteen this version and previous versions is that I am
attempting to use proper python packaging rules!. I have separated out the main
parts of the code and the command line inputs so that you can use the libraries
yourself or do it all from the command line. This should also - hopefully - make
it easier for the production of Jupyter notebooks. The latter are to be developed
by UNAVCO with NASA GNSS Science Team funding.

*If you would like to try out reflectometry without installing the code*

I recommend you use the web app [I developed](https://gnss-reflections.org). It 
can show you representative results with minimal constraints. It should provide 
results in less than 10 seconds.

*If you prefer Matlab*

I had a [working matlab version on github](https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssIR_matlab_v3), 
but I will not be updating it. You will very likely have to make changes to accommodate the recent
change in security protocols at CDDIS.

*Goals*

The goal of this python repository is to help you compute (and evaluate) GNSS-based
reflectometry parameters using geodetic data. This method is often
called GNSS-IR, or GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry. There are three main modules:

* **rinex2snr** translates RINEX files into SNR files needed for analysis.

* **gnssir** computes reflector heights (RH) from SNR files.

* **quickLook** gives you a quick (visual) assessment of a file without dealing
with the details associated with **gnssir**. It is not meant to be used for routine analysis.

There are also various utilities you might find to be useful (see the last section).

*This document is not a class about GNSS interferometric reflectometry.* 
If you are unsure about why various 
restrictions are being applied, you really need
to read [Roesler and Larson (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-018-0744-8) 
and similar. I am committed in principle to set up some online
courses to teach people about GNSS reflections, but funding for these courses is 
not in hand at the moment. 

To summarize, direct (blue) and reflected (red) GNSS signals interfere and create
an interference pattern that can be observed in GNSS data as a satellite rises or sets. 
The frequency of this interference pattern is directly related to the height of the antenna phase
center above the reflecting surface, or reflector height RH (purple). Accordingly, this code strips out 
rising and setting satellite arcs and estimates RH.

### Installing the Code<a name="environment"></a>

*Environment Variables*
   
You should define three environment variables:

* EXE = where various RINEX executables will live.

* ORBITS = where the GPS/GNSS orbits will be stored. They will be listed under directories by 
year and sp3 or nav depending on the orbit format.

* REFL_CODE = where the reflection code inputs (SNR files and instructions) and outputs (RH)
will be stored (see below). Both SNR files and results will be saved here in year subdirectories.

If you don't define these environment variables, the code should assume your local working directory (where you installed
the code) is where you want everything to be. The orbits, SNR files, and periodogram results are stored in 
directories in year, followed by type, i.e. snr, results, sp3, nav, and then by station name.

*Installing the Python*

If you are using the version from gitHub:

* git clone https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl 
* cd into that directory, set up a virtual environment, a la python3 -m venv env 
* activate your virtual environment
* pip install .

If you use the PyPi version:  

* make a directory, cd into that directory, set up a virtual environment 
* activate the virtual environment
* pip install gnssrefl

To use **only** python codes, you will need to be sure that your RINEX files are not Hatanaka 
compressed.

*Non-Python Code*

**All executables must be stored in the EXE directory.**  If you do not define EXE, 
it will look for them in your local working directory.  The Fortran translators are 
much faster than using python. We now advocate using the hybrid translator option, which 
links to the Fortran internally. Using true python to translate a high-rate GPS file is 
impossibly slow.

* Required Translator for compressed (Hatanaka) RINEX files. CRX2RNX, http://terras.gsi.go.jp/ja/crx2rnx.html. 

* Optional Fortran RINEX Translator for GPS. **The executable must be called gpsSNR.e.** For the code: https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gpsonlySNR

* Optional Fortran RINEX translator for multi-GNSS. **The executable must be called gnssSNR.e** For the code: https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssSNR

* Optional datatool, **teqc**, is highly recommended.  There is a list of static executables at the
bottom of [this page](http://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/teqc.html). 

* Optional datatool, **gfzrnx** is required if you plan to use the RINEX 3 option. Executables available from the GFZ,
http://dx.doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.1.1.2016.002. 


### rinex2snr - making SNR files from RINEX files <a name="module1"></a>

The international standard for sharing GNSS data is called 
the [RINEX format](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/RINEX211.txt).
A RINEX file has extraneous information in it (which we will throw out) - and it 
does not provide some of the information needed for reflectometry (e.g. elevation and azimuth angles). 
The first task you have in GNSS-IR is to translate from RINEX into what I will 
call the SNR format. The latter will include azimuth and elevation angles. For the 
latter you will need an **orbit** file. **rinex2snr**
will go get an orbit file for you. You can override the default orbit 
choice by selections given below.

There is no reason to save ALL the RINEX data as the reflections are only useful at the lower elevation
angles. The default is to save all data with elevation lower than 30 degrees (this is called SNR format 66).
Another SNR choice is 99, which saves elevation angle data between 5 and 30.  

There are rules for naming RINEX files. **My code requires that RINEX (version 2) files be lowercase.**
The filename must be 12 characters long (ssssddd0.yyo), where ssss is station name, 
ddd is day of year, followed by a zero, yy is the two character year and o stands for observation. 
If you have installed the CRX2RNX code, you can also provide a compressed RINEX format file, which ends in a d.
I think my code allows you to gzip the RINEX files if you are providing them.

You can run **rinex2snr** at the command line. You required inputs are:

- station name
- year
- day of year

A sample call for a station called p041, restricted to GPS satellites, on day of year 132 and year 2020 would be:

*rinex2snr p041 2020 132*

If the RINEX file for p041 is in your local directory, it will translate it.  If not, 
it will check four archives (unavco, sopac, cddis, and sonel) to find it. 
This uses the hybrid translator.  If you did install a fortran translator, the command would be:

*rinex2snr p041 2020 132 -translator fortran* 

For python:

*rinex2snr p041 2020 132 -translator python* 


Here is an example from a site in Greenland (the RINEX file will be picked up from unavco):

*rinex2snr gls1 2011 271* 

The code will also search ga (geoscience Australia), nz (New Zealand), 
ngs, and bkg if you invoke -archive, e.g.

*rinex2snr tgho 2020 132 -archive nz*

What if you want to run the code for all the data for a given year?  This command 
analyzes all the data from the year 2019.

*rinex2snr tgho 2019 1  -archive nz -doy_end 365* 
 
If your station name has 9 characters (lower case please), the code assumes you are looking for a 
RINEX 3 file. However, my code will store the SNR data using the normal
4 character name. **You must install the gfzrnx executable that translates RINEX 3 to 2 to use RINEX 3 files
in my code.** *rinex2snr* currently only looks for RINEX 3 files at CDDIS (30 sec) and UNAVCO (15 sec).  There 
are more archive options in **download_rinex** and someday I will merge these. If you do have your own RINEX 3
files, I use the community standard, that is upper case except for the extension (which is rnx).  I know, it is weird.

Here are some examples for RINEX 3 conversions:

*rinex2snr onsa00swe 2020 298*

*rinex2snr at0100usa 2020 55*

*rinex2snr mdo100usa 2020 290*

*rinex2snr mkea00usa 2020 290*

The snr options are mostly based on the need to remove the "direct" signal. This is 
not related to a specific site mask and that is why the most frequently used 
options (99 and 66) have a maximum elevation angle of 30 degrees. The
azimuth-specific mask is decided later when you need to run **gnssir**.  The SNR choices are:

- 66 is elevation angles less than 30 degrees (**this is the default**)
- 99 is elevation angles of 5-30 degrees  
- 88 is elevation angles of 5-90 degrees
- 50 is elevation angles less than 10 degrees (good for very tall sites, high-rate applications)


*orbit file options for general users:*

- gps : will use GPS broadcast orbits (**this is the default**)
- gps+glos : will use JAXA orbits which have GPS and Glonass (usually available in 48 hours)
- gnss : will use GFZ orbits, which is multi-GNSS (available in 3-4 days?)

*orbit file options for experts:*

- nav : GPS broadcast, perfectly adequate for reflectometry. 
- igs : IGS precise, GPS only
- igr : IGS rapid, GPS only
- jax : JAXA, GPS + Glonass, within a few days, very reliable
- gbm : GFZ Potsdam, multi-GNSS, not rapid
- grg: French group, GPS, Galileo and Glonass, not rapid
- wum : Wuhan, multi-GNSS, not rapid

Other questions:

- What if you do not want to install the fortran translators?  Use -translator hybrid (though I believe this is the default)

- What if you are providing the RINEX files and you don't want the code to search for 
the files online? Use -nolook True

There is a **rate** command line input that has two values, high or low. However, if you invoke high,
it currently only looks at the UNAVCO, GA, or NRCAN archives. Please beware - it takes a long time to download a 
highrate GNSS RINEX file (even when it is compressed). 
And it also takes a long time to compute orbits for it (and thus create a SNR file).
If you did not install the Fortan RINEX translators, it takes a very, very, long time.

### quickLook <a name="module2"></a>

Before using the **gnssir** code, I recommend you try **quickLook**. This allows you
to quickly test various options (elevation angles, frequencies, azimuths).
The required inputs are station name, year, and doy of year. **You must have previously translated a RINEX file using rinex2snr for this to work.**

**quickLook** has stored defaults for analyzing the spectral characteristics of the SNR data. 
In general these defaults are meant to facilitate users where the antenna is less than 5 meters tall.**
If your site is taller than that, you will need to override the defaults.
Similarly, the default elevation angles are 5-25 degrees. If that mask includes a reflection region
you don't want to use, you need to override them.

For more information, use *quickLook -h*

Going back to our **rinex2snr** example, try running the data for station p041.

*quickLook p041 2020 132*  

That command will produce [this periodogram summary](tests/use_cases/p041-l1.png). By default, 
these are L1 data only. Note that the x-axis does not go beyond 6 meters. This is because
you have used the defaults.  Furthermore, note that results on the x-axis begin at 0.5 meters.
Since you are not able to resolve very small reflector heights with this method, this region 
is not allowed. These periodograms give you a sense of whether there is a 
planar reflector below your antenna. The fact that 
the peaks in the periodograms bunch up around 2 meters means that at 
this site the antenna phase center is ~ 2 meters above the ground. The colors 
change as you try different satellites.  If the data are plotted in
gray that means you have a failed reflection. The quadrants are Northwest, Northeast and so on. 

If you want to look at L2C data, [try this by invoking -fr 20](tests/use_cases/p041-l2c.png). 
In general, the results will be cleaner than L1 data (frequency number 1 in my code).
The defaults reflector heights will not go beyond 6 meters.  If you had set -h2 20, it would
look [like this](tests/use_cases/p041-l2c-again.png). You aren't gaining anything by doing this.

Now look at the Greenland SNR file you created in the previous section.

*quickLook gls1 2011 271* 

The periodogram peaks bunch up at a [larger value](tests/use_cases/gls1-example.png), which just
means the antenna was further from the planar reflector, which in this case is ice.

Finally, what do you do if your reflections site is taller than the default value of 6 meters?
Does the code figure this out for you automatically? **No, it does not.**
A short example: Make a SNR file using the defaults: *rinex2snr smm3 2018 271*
Now run **quickLook** using the defaults [quickLook smm3 2018 271](tests/use_cases/smm3-default.png). 
Everything is gray (which means it didn't find a significant reflector) because you 
only calculated periodograms for height values of 0.5 to 6 meters. The
site is ~16 meters above the ice. Accordingly, if you change the inputs to tell the program
that you want to examine heights between 8 and 20 meters, i.e. 
[quickLook smm3 2018 271 -h1 8 -h2 20](tests/use_cases/smm3-sensible.png) you now see what you 
expect to see - peaks of periodograms at ~16 meters height. Why is the northwest quadrant 
so messy? I leave that as an exercise for the reader. Hint: start out by trying
to examine this site on Google Earth.

### gnssir <a name="module3"></a>

This is the main driver for the GNSS-IR code.  
You need a set of instructions for **gnssir** which are made using **make_json_input**.  
The inputs for **make_json_input** are: 

* station name 
* latitude (degrees)  
* longitude (degrees) 
* ellipsoidal height (meters). 

The station location does not have to be cm-level for the reflections code. Within a few hundred meters is sufficient.  
For example: 

*make_json_input p101 41.692 -111.236 2016.1* 

If you happen to have the Cartesian coordinates (in meters), you can set -xyz True and input those instead of 
lat, long, and height.

It will use defaults for other parameters if you do not provide them. Those defaults 
tell the code an azimuth and elevation angle mask (i.e. which directions you want 
to allow reflections from), and which frequencies you want to use, and various quality control (QC) metrics. 
Right now the default frequencies are GPS only, e.g. L1, L2C and L5. 
The json file of instructions will be put in $REFL_CODE/input/p101.json. You should look at 
it to get an idea of the kinds of inputs the code uses.
The default azimuths can be changed, but this needs to be done by hand. Some parameters can be set
via the command line, as in:

*make_json_input p101 41.692 -111.236 2016.1 -e1 5 -e2 10* 

This changes elevation angles to 5-10 degrees.

As discussed in Roesler and Larson (2018), there are two QC measures used in this code. One is the peak 
value of the peak in the periodogram. In the example below the amplitude of the most significant 
peak is ~17, so if you define the required amplitude 
to be 15, this one would pass. Secondly it uses a very simple peak to noise calculation. In this case the 
average periodogram amplitude value is calculated for a RH region that you define, and that is the "noise". 
You then take the peak value (here ~17) and divide by the "noise" value.  
For water I generally recommend a peak to noise ratio of 2.7, but for snow 3.2-3.5 or so. It can be tricky 
to set these QC values in general. 

<img src="https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl/blob/master/tests/for_the_web.png" width="500"/>

Things that are helpful to know for the make_json_input inputs:

*Names for the GNSS frequencies*

- 1,2,5 are GPS L1, L2, L5
- 20 is GPS L2C 
- 101,102 Glonass L1 and L2
- 201, 205, 206, 207, 208: Galileo frequencies
- 302, 306, 307 : Beidou frequencies

* Some json settings can be set at the command line.  run **make_json_input -h** to see these.  Otherwise, edit the json file.

- e1 and e2 are the min and max elevation angle, in degrees
- minH and maxH are the min and max allowed reflector height, in meters
- desiredP, desired reflector height precision, in meters
- PkNoise is the periodogram peak divided by the periodogram noise ratio.  
- reqAmp is the required periodogram amplitude value, in volts/volts
- polyV is the polynomial order used for removing the direct signal
- freqs are selected frequencies for analysis
- delTmax is the maximum length of allowed satellite arc, in minutes
- azval are the azimuth regions for study, in pairs (i.e. 0 90 270 360 means you want to evaluate 0 to 90 and 270 to 360).
- wantCompression, boolean, compress SNR files
- screenstats, boolean, whether minimal periodogram results come to screen
- refraction, boolean, whether simple refraction model is applied.
- plt_screen: boolean, whether SNR data and periodogram are plotted to the screen 
- NReg [min and max required] : define the RH region where the "noise value" for the periodogram 
is computed. This is used to compute the peak to noise ratio used i n QC.
- (*this option has been removed*) seekRinex: boolean, whether code looks for RINEX at an archive


Simple example for my favorite GPS site [p041](https://spotlight.unavco.org/station-pages/p042/eo/scientistPhoto.jpg)

- *make_json_input p041 39.949 -105.194 1728.856* (use defaults and write out a json instruction file)
- *rinex2snr p041 2020 150* (pick up and translate RINEX file for day of year 150 and year 2020 from unavco )
- *gnssir p041 2020 150* (calculate the reflector heights) 
- *gnssir p041 2020 150 -fr 5 -plt True* (override defaults, only look at L5 SNR data, and periodogram plots come to the screen)

Where would the code store the files for this example?

- json instructions are stored in $REFL_CODE/input/p041.json
- SNR files are stored in $REFL_CODE/2020/snr/p041
- Reflector Height (RH) results are stored in $REFL_CODE/2020/results/p041

This is a snippet of what the result file would look like

<img src="https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl/blob/master/tests/results-snippet.png" width="600">

- *Amp* is the amplitude of the most significant peak in the periodogram (i.e. the amplitude for the RH you estimated).  
- *DelT* is how long a given rising or setting satellite arc was, in minutes. 
- *emin0* and *emax0* are the min and max observed elevation angles in the arc.
- *rise/set* tells you wehther the satellite arc was rising or setting
- *Azim* is the average azimuth angle of the satellite arc
- *sat* and *freq* are as defined in this document

If you want a multi-GNSS solution, you need to make a new json file and 
use multi-GNSS orbits, and use a RINEX file that has multi-GNSS SNR observations in it. 
p041 currently has multi-GNSS data in the RINEX file, so you can use it as a test. 

- *make_json_input p041 39.949 -105.194 1728.856 -allfreq True* 
- *rinex2snr p041 2020 151 -orb gnss* 
- *gnssir p041 2020 151 -fr 201 -plt True* (look at the lovely Galileo L1 data) 

What should the periodogram plots look like? Until we have Jupyter notebooks, I 
recommend you look at [the paper I wrote with Carolyn Roesler](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-018-0744-8) 
or the [question section of my web app.](https://gnss-reflections.org/overview). Note that a failed
arc is shown as gray in the periodogram plots. And once you know what you are doing (have picked
the azimuth and elevation angle mask), you won't be looking at plots anymore.

### Bugs/Features <a name="bugs"></a>

I have been using **teqc** to reduce the number of observables and to decimate. I have removed the former 
because it unfortunately- by default - removes Beidou observations in Rinex 2.11 files. If you request decimation 
and fortran is set to True, unfortunately this will still occur. I am working on removing my 
code's dependence on **teqc**.

The hybrid translator option is currently only for GPS satellites. It does not cover multi-GNSS.

No phase center offsets have been applied to these reflector heights. While these values are relatively small,
we do plan to remove them in subsequent versions of the code. 

The L2C and L5 GPS satellite lists are not time coded as they should be. I currently use a list from 2020.

### Utilities <a name="helper"></a>

**daily averages** is a utility for cryosphere people interested in computing daily snow 
accumulation. It can be used for lake levels. *It is not to be used for tides!*

**download_rinex** can be useful if you want to download RINEX v2 or 3 files (using the version flag) without using 
the reflection-specific codes. Sample calls:

- *download_rinex p041 2020 6 1* downloads the data from June 1, 2020

- *download_rinex p041 2020 150 0* downloads the data from day of year 150 in 2020

- *download_rinex p041 2020 150 0 -archive sopac* downloads the data from sopac archive on day of year 150 in 2020

**download_orbits** downloads orbit files. See -h for more information.

**ymd** translates year,month,day to day of year

**ydoy** translates year,day of year to month and day

**llh2xyz** translates latitude, longitude, and ellipsoidal ht to X, Y, Z

**xyz2llh** translates Cartesian coordinates to latitude, longitude, height

**download_tides** downloads up to a month of NOAA tide gauge data given station number (7 characters),
and begin/end dates, e.g. 20150601 would be June 1, 2015. The NOAA API works perfectly well for this,
but this utility writes out a file with only numbers (which I always prefer) instead of 
csv. And I did not need to learn how to use pandas.

### Publications <a name="publications"></a>

There are A LOT of publications about GPS and GNSS interferometric reflectometry.
If you want something with a how-to flavor, try this paper, 
which is [open option](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-018-0744-8)

Also look to the publications page on my [personal website](https://kristinelarson.net/publications)
