## Homework 2 Solution

*Make SNR file for gls1, 2012, doy 100*  quickLook*

<code>rinex2snr gls1 2012 100 -archive unavco </code>

*Run quickLook*

<code>quickLook gls1 2012 100</code>

This makes two plots.  

<img src=hw2_period.png width=500/>
<P>
<img src=hw2_summary.png width=500/>


*Looking at the QC metrics plots created by <code>quickLook</code>, do you have some ideas on how to change the azimuth mask angles?*

I've outlined in red the areas that consistently produce unsuccessful 
retrievals.  Even though it seesm the software is reliably removing them, we can remove 
them in the analysis strategy file. Note that the default 
peak2noise is 3 in <code>quickLook</code>. This is a bit higher than the gnssir default.

*Now make SNR files for gls1 for the all of 2012.*

<code>rinex2snr gls1 2012 1 -archive unavco -doy_end 366 -weekly True</code>

*We will next analyze a year of L1 GPS reflection data from gls1. We will use the default minimum and maximum 
reflector height values (0.5 and 6 meters). But for the reasons previously stated, you will want to 
set a minimum elevation angle of 7 degrees. We also specify that we only want to use the L1 data.*

If you cannot remember the coordinates of gls1, you can try:

<code>query_unr gls1</code>

Note: the query_unr code was recently updated to include more precision 
for coordinates. This precision is *not* needed for make_json_input.
Although it is not required, I am going to override the dfeaults for peak2noise and reqamp to mimic what is used by quickLook.

<code>make_json_input gls1 66.479391272 -46.310152753 2148.5783167 -l1 True -e1 7 -peak2noise 3 -ampl 8 </code>

*Hand-edit the azimuths in the json file to:*

```
"azval": [ 40, 90, 90, 180, 180, 270, 270, 330 ],
```

[Here is my json file](gls1.json)
    
*Now that you have SNR files and json inputs, you can go ahead and 
estimate reflector heights for the year 2012 using <code>gnssir</code>.
Note that it is normal to see 'Could not read the first SNR file:' because we 
only created SNR files once a week.*

<code>gnssir gls1 2012 1 -doy_end 366</code>

*Now you can use the <code>daily_avg</code> tool to compute a daily average reflector height for gls1. 
Try setting the median filter to 0.25 meters and individual tracks to 30.*

<code>daily_avg gls1 0.25 30</code>

This code produces three plots and a daily average (txt or csv) file. My plots have 
every day of 2012 shown beacuse I made SNR files for each day of the year. Yours 
will only have one point per week.

This is all the individual RH:

<img src=gls1-av.png width=500/>

This is the daily average after outliers have been removed:

<img src=gls1-av2.png width=500/>

This lets you know how many arcs went into each day's average:

<img src=gls1-av3.png width=500/>

*Note that RH is plotted on the y-axis with RH decreasing rather than increasing. Why do you think we did that?*

Most people are interested in snow accumulation, so reversing the y-axis accommodates that.

[Here is the text file of the RH result for 2012.](gls1_dailyRH.txt)
